### First of all, check for non-public cookbooks in our local Chef server
### Ideally non-public cookbooks should be in a private supermarket but this
### is just a training cookbook and we may not have one set up yet
#source :chef_server

### If we did have a private supermarket we could declare it here
#source 'https://supermarket.myorg.internal'

### Last resort is to go to public supermarket
source 'https://supermarket.chef.io'
