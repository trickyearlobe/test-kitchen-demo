# test-kitchen-demo

This is an example cookbook we can use to play around with test kitchen.
It aims to help students to understand the benefits of:-
* Automated testing
* Test driven development

There are several mistakes and pieces of work to fix using a TDD style workflow.

To get started, clone the repo and run:-
* ```cd test-kitchen-demo```
* ```berks install```
* ```rspec```
* ```kitchen test```


NOTE:
The ChefSpec and Inspec tests are testing different things...
This intentional so novices can figure out which parts of the repo
relate to ChefSpec and which ones relate to Inspec.
